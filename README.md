Advanced Web Scraper (Python)

Web Scraper written in Python. 

Hello! I created this program for my CSI-160 Python programming course. 
This is my final project for the course.

There are two main functions of this program:
1. To retrieve the html content of a website using just it's URL.
2. To do a targeted scrape by using the websites url, the class type in the html that the user wants to scrape, and the class name.

This program gives you the option to save URL's you enter into the scraper to be saved to a URL history list.
These are only saved for your viewing during your current session, locally. They aren't saved anywhere else. 
The program also gives the option whether to save URL's or not into URL history. 

In addition to URL's, data pulled from websites is not saved in any way.
